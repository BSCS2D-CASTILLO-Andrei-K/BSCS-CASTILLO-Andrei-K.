<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Unleash Human Potential.</h2>
<p id="about-p">At Nike, we believe in the power of sport to move the world. We are more than just a brand—we are a movement. 
     A movement that celebrates athletes of all kinds and empowers them to break barriers, push limits,
     and redefine what's possible.</p>

<h2>Our Story: <br> A Legacy of Innovation</h2>
<p id="about-p">Founded in 1964 by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, Nike began with a single vision: to bring inspiration 
     and innovation to every athlete in the world. Over the years, we've become a symbol of excellence and dedication, 
     continuously redefining the boundaries of sportswear, technology, and design. From the iconic swoosh to the revolutionary
     Nike Air we've never stopped pushing ourselves to create products that inspire confidence, performance, and self-expression.
     Whether it's a record-breaking sprint on the track or a personal best in the gym, Nike is here to help you achieve your dreams.</p>

<h2>Innovation Meets Inspiration</h2>
<p id="about-p">We don't just make shoes, clothes, and gear—we create the tools that elevate your game. 
     From Nike Flyknit to Nike Training Club, we are constantly developing cutting-edge technology 
     to ensure that athletes, at every level, perform at their peak. Every product is designed with a 
     single goal in mind:to give you the support, flexibility, and confidence you need to push the limits of your sport.</p>

<h2>Join Us.</h2>
